### 1. Case Study #1 - Danny's Diner - [View Project](https://github.com/Vaishali-Rishi/CS1_Danny_Diner/blob/main/README.md)
- This case-study is a part of 8 weeks SQL Challenge brought to us by the Danny Ma.
- In this project, I analyzed customer behavior and preferences for Danny's Diner by answering key questions about their spending, visiting patterns, and favorite menu items using SQL.
- The insights derived would help Danny personalize customer experiences and evaluate the expansion of the loyalty program.
